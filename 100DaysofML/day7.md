# Current milestones
* create a project plan and learn how this is properly done in software engineering

# Ideas

## DNN architecture
* download minutely data for 20 tech company -(same timestamps)
* create plotting tool to go through time series, create interface for buy and sell commands
* experiment with RNN, LSTM, GRU and attention based models how they perform modeling the trends
  * decide which architecture will be the basis for the deep RL trader
* test robustness with other tech companies
  * what would happen if the same architecture was trained on multiple datasets and the weights were averaged?
  * Is it possible to use some stocks as test and others as training data?

## RL agent
* learn how to feed back the loss
* add risk and profit indicators and give it a first shot
* visualize the decisions in the plotting tool
* train the model until it is hopefully profitable in the model environment
