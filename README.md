# Reinforcement Trading
Training of NNs to analyze Stock prices and of an RL agent that simulates trading based on the models provided

# Objectives
This whole endevour is not about making money trading stocks or currencies but is about having a practical application for learning about the following concepts:

* Increase proficiency with git, writing docs and structuring as well as managing projects 
* Use a web APIs to acquire data 
* Reinforcement Learning (Probably Q-Learning since this has been applied with reasonable results)
* RNN, LSTM, GRU and maybe attention based models
* Baselines: Prophet, ARIMA, 
* Using AWS to scale up my computational power
* Implement adequate ways of visualizing data
* Document code to ensure reproducability
  * Sphinx
* Deployment of the code  
* Speed up Python 
  * Parallel computing
  * Profiling
  * Pypy
  * Cython
  * numba, dask
  * C-extensions
 
** The goal is not to make money trading stocks and I don't claim that it would be wise to use anything from this project to do so **

# Optional goals:
* Set up a SQL server to store data even if that is not necessary for the amounts of data used 
* Write a Kalman filter / boosting / ensemble to see if that could be a good idea
