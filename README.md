# ReinforcementTrading
Training of NNs to analyze Stock prices and of an RL agent that trades based on the models provided

# Objectives
This whole endevour is not about making money trading stocks or currencies but is about having a practical application for learning the following concepts:

* Using web APIs to acquire data 
* Reinforcement Learning 
* RNN, LSTM, GRU and attention based models
* Using AWS to scale my computational power
* Creating graphical user interfaces / implement adequate ways of visualizing data
* Document code to ensure reproducability
  * Sphinx
* Deployment of the code  

Optional goals:
* Set up an SQL server to store data even if that is not necessary for the amounts of data used 
* Write a Kalman filter 
* Speed up Python 
  * Parallel computing
  * Profiling
  * Pypy
  * Cython
  * numba, dask
